# To do list

- [ ] Add the energy value to the muons according to the spectrum used in the simulation. And its velocity calculated with it.
- [ ] Add the Moliére Multiple Coulomb scattering.
- [ ] Add the lead above the detector.
- [ ] Validate the avalanche charge with GARFIELD, maybe.
- [ ] Instead of putting the rate in the last steps, put the timestamp already in the first step, depending on the flux, as I had done at some point. Then we could easily relate the final rate with an original rate.
