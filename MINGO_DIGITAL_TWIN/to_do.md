# To do list

- [ ] Add the energy value to the muons according to the spectrum used in the simulation. And its velocity calculated with it.
- [ ] Add the Moliére Multiple Coulomb scattering.
- [ ] Add the lead above the detector.
- [ ] Validate the avalanche charge with GARFIELD, maybe.
- [ ] Instead of putting the rate in the last steps, put the timestamp already in the first step, depending on the flux, as I had done at some point. Then we could easily relate the final rate with an original rate.
- [ ] Add the efficiency dependence with the angle of incidence. Maybe we could try to implement it from the intrinsic efficiency we have already put, using the oblique trace, and try to get from there a dependence and see if we replicate the experimental data.
- [ ] Add the dark rate of the detector.
- [ ] Add the crosstalk.
- [ ] Add the one side measurements.
- [ ] Put the Townsend coeff from the HV, pressure and Temperature, if possible.
