Docstring for INFERENCE_DICTIONARY_VALIDATION.STEP_3_SYNTHETIC_TIME_SERIES.STEP_3_3_CORRECTION.correction_by_inference

This code will simply run the inference using the dictionary for the synthetic dataset generated, which
should have the exact same morphology as the original dataset, same columns and all. include the uncertainty
estimation. Output plots: a diagonal original flux vs data flux with y = x, another
identical with the efficiency, another with the flux time series and the eff time series
and the retrieved flux and eff time series (with the uncertainty bands).
